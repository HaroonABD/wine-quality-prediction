# Prediction-of-Wine-Quality

I harnessed the power of multiple classification algorithms, including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Gaussian Naive Bayes, to distinguish and predict the quality of wines based on their features.

Employing Python's rich ecosystem of data science libraries, I embarked on data exploration and preprocessing. Using techniques such as count plots and kernel density estimation (KDE) plots, I gained invaluable insights into the distribution and characteristics of the dataset, enabling me to make informed decisions during the modelling process.

To gain deeper insights into feature relationships, I visualized feature correlations through heatmap representations, and I explored the interactions between variables using pair plots and violin plots. These visualizations enhanced my understanding of the dataset and facilitated crucial feature selection and model validation steps.

For the predictive modelling phase, I applied a diverse set of algorithms, carefully fine-tuning hyperparameters to optimize each model's performance. This approach allowed me to identify which algorithms were best suited for the specific task of predicting wine quality, and I discovered the strengths and weaknesses of each approach in the context of the dataset.

Furthermore, I implemented techniques to combat overfitting and validated model accuracy using appropriate metrics. The project's highlight was witnessing the various algorithms in action and observing how they collectively contributed to enhancing wine quality predictions.

For this project, I used Kaggle’s Red Wine Quality dataset to build various classification models to predict whether a particular red wine is “good quality” or not. Each wine in this dataset is given a “quality” score between 0 and 10. For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary result where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables:

    Fixed acidity
    Volatile acidity
    Citric acid
    Residual sugar
    Chlorides
    Free sulfur dioxide
    Total sulfur dioxide
    Density
    pH
    Sulfates
    Alcohol

Objectives

The objectives of this project are as follows:

    To experiment with different classification methods to see which yields the highest accuracy
    To determine which features are the most indicative of a good quality wine.
